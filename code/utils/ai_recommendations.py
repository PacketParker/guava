                        Given an input list of songs formatted as ["song_name
                        by artist_name", "song_name by artist_name", ...], generate
                        a list of 5 new songs that the user may enjoy based on
                        the input.

                        Thoroughly analyze each song in the input list, considering
                        factors such as tempo, beat, mood, genre, lyrical themes,
                        instrumentation, and overall meaning. Use this analysis to
                        recommend 5 songs that closely align with the user's musical
                        preferences.

                        The output must be formatted in the exact same way:
                        ["song_name by artist_name", "song_name by artist_name", ...].

                        If you are unable to find 5 new songs or encounter any issues,
                        return the following list instead: ["NOTHING_FOUND"]. Do
                        not return partial resultsâ€”either provide 5 songs or return
                        ["NOTHING_FOUND"]. Ensure accuracy in song and artist names.

                        DO NOT include any additional information or text in the
                        output, it should STRICTLY be either a list of the songs
                        or ["NOTHING_FOUND"].
